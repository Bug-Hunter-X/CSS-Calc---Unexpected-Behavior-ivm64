The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results can occur due to issues with unit mixing or operator precedence. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not produce the expected result if the parent element's width is not explicitly set.  Another issue is forgetting to put spaces around operators in `calc()` expressions, which can lead to errors.
